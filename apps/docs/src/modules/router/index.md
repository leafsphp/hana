# Routing
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->

::: tip
Leaf router is now separated from Leaf and is now available as an installable module via composer or the leaf cli.
:::

Leaf router uses a single root file, to which all the server requests are redirected, it then takes these requests and matches them to rules you have defined. The results are then displayed to the user. It's actually a very simple concept.

::: warning Note
Leaf router is automatically installed and attached to your leaf apps, so you don't need to manually install it. This guide focuses on leaf router and a general application of it. If you want the leaf routing guide with leaf router, check out [routing](/docs/routing/) instead.
:::

You can install the leaf router with composer:

```bash
composer require leafs/router
```

or with leaf CLI:

```bash
leaf install router
```

After this, you can use all of leaf router's functionality with the router class below.

## Router class

The router class is the interface you interact with to perform any routing actions in your app. Leaf core directly integrates with the router class, which means that there is no need to use this class directly, if however, you are using leaf router outside of leaf, you will need to use the router class itself.

```php
use Leaf\Router;

Router::get("/", "PagesController@index");

Router::run();
```

## Creating Routes

::: warning IMPORTANT
From this point onwards, we will assume that you are using Leaf router outside a leaf app, as such, we will use the router class syntax:

```php
Router::get('/', function () {...});
```

Check out the [routing guide](/docs/routing/) for an application tailored for leaf apps.

:::

You can define application routes using proxy methods on the Leaf\App instance. Leaf supports different types of requests, let's look at them.

### GET

You can add a route that handles only GET HTTP requests with the Leaf router's get() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::get('/home', function () {
  // your code
});
```

### POST

You can add a route that handles only POST HTTP requests with the Leaf router's post() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::post('/users/add', function () use($request) {
  $user = $request->get('user');
  // create a new user
});
```

### PUT requests

You can add a route that handles only PUT HTTP requests with the Leaf routerâ€™s put() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::put('/book/edit/{id}', function ($id) {
  // your code
});
```

### DELETE requests

You can add a route that handles only DELETE HTTP requests with the Leaf router's delete() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::delete('/quotes/{id}', function ($id) {
  // delete quote
});
```

### OPTIONS requests

You can add a route that handles only OPTIONS HTTP requests with the Leaf router's options() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::options('/quotes/{id}', function ($id) {
  // return headers
});
```

### PATCH requests

You can add a route that handles only PATCH HTTP requests with the Leaf router's patch() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::patch('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
  // your code
});
```

### ALL requests

You can add a route that handles all HTTP requests with the Leaf router's all() method. It accepts two arguments:

- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::all('/post/{id}', function ($id) {
  // your code
});
```

### View

**`view` is no longer supported, as Leaf Blade is no longer default in Leaf. You'll have to manually show your views using `get`**

### Resource Routes

This section assumes you've read [working with controllers](/docs/routing/controller). In an MVC application, controllers play a major role as they're the bridge between your view and your model.

A resource route simply creates all the routes needed to successfully handle a particular feature. This sounds a bit bleak, let's look at an example.

```php
Router::resource("/posts", "PostsController");

Router::run();
```

The code above is equivalent to this:

```php
Router::match("GET|HEAD", "/posts", "$controller@index");
Router::post("/posts", "$controller@store");
Router::match("GET|HEAD", "/posts/create", "$controller@create");
Router::match("POST|DELETE", "/posts/{id}/delete", "$controller@destroy");
Router::match("POST|PUT|PATCH", "/posts/{id}/edit", "$controller@update");
Router::match("GET|HEAD", "/posts/{id}/edit", "$controller@edit");
Router::match("GET|HEAD", "/posts/{id}", "$controller@show");

Router::run();
```

Resource routes are handled by a [resource controller](/docs/routing/controller?id=resource-controller).

### Route "Hooking"

You can add a route that handles a couple of HTTP methods with the Leaf router's match() method. It accepts three arguments:

- The HTTP method(s) seperated by |
- The route pattern (with optional named placeholders or PCRE based patterns)
- The route callback

```php
Router::match('GET|POST', '/people', function () {
  // your code
});
```

### Running your routes

After setting all the routes, you'll need to dispatch the routes. This is achieved through Leaf's run() method.

```php
Router::run();
```

### Route options

This is the biggest change Leaf router has seen over the period of a year. Route options simply allow you to configure the way groups and individual routes by passing in additional parameters. In actual sense, all new features were generated as a result of this single feature. Let's see how it works.

Leaf route handlers are usually callable functions like this:

```php
Router::get("/home", function () {
  echo "User Home";
});
```

Or sometimes controllers, like this:

```php
Router::get("/home", "HomeController@index");
```

This means there was no space to chain additional items to the route, this is solved by route options.

```php
Router::get("/home", ["name" => "home", function () {
    echo "User Home";
}]);
```

When an array is passed into a leaf route as the handler, leaf will take all `key => value` as options for that route, the first non key-value `function` or `controller` in the array is taken as the handler.

```php
Router::get("/form", ["name" => "userForm", "FormsController@index"]);
```

As mentioned before, this feature is also available on groups:

```php
Router::group("/user", ["namespace" => "\\", function () {
    // ...
}]);
```

**This doesn't mean that you should always pass in an array, if you don't need the other options, you can pass in your function or controller directly as you've always done.**

### Naming your routes

From v2.5.0 of Leaf, you can give route names which you can call them with instead of using the path (Inspired by vue-router).

```php
Router::get("/home", ["name" => "home", function () {
  echo "User Home";
}]);
```

### Pushing to a route

This is simply redirecting to a route and can be done using `push`. `push` also allows you to reference the route by it's name instead of it's path.

```php
Router::push("/home");
```

When an array is passed into push, Leaf will search for a route name matching the string in the array and redirect to that route:

```php
// home was defined above
Router::push(["home"]);
```
