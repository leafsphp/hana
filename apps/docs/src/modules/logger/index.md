# Logger
<!-- markdownlint-disable no-inline-html -->

Leaf now provides very well defined logging support for your apps. A sample log looks like this:

```log
[2021-03-31 22:44:53]
ERROR - ErrorException: Trying to access array offset on value of type int in /home/mychi/Projects/leafphp/leaf/src/Experimental/Cache.php:83

```

A Leaf provides a log object that writes data to a specific output. The actual writing of data is delegated to a log writer.

**You need to configure the log directory so that Leaf knows where to place your files.**

```php
<?php

$app = new Leaf\App([
    "log.dir" => __DIR__ . "/logs/",
]);
```

or

```php
<?php

Config::set("log.dir", __DIR__ . "/logs/");
```

## How to log data

To log data, get a reference to the log object:

```php
<?php
$log = $app->logger();
```

The log object provides the following PSR-3 interface

```php
$app->logger()->debug(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->info(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->notice(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->warning(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->error(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->critical(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->alert(mixed $object);
$app->logger()->emergency(mixed $object);
```

Each log object method accepts one mixed argument. The argument is usually a string, but the argument can be anything. The log object will pass the argument to its log writer. It is the log writerâ€™s responsibility to write arbitrary input to the appropriate destination.
