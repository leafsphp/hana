# You Did It!

You've completed the tutorial!

At this point, you should have a good idea of what it's like to work with Leaf. However, we covered a lot of things really fast and glossed over the details, so you should definitely keep learning and read the docs! As a next step, you can:

- Set up a real Leaf project on your machine by following the [installation docs](/docs/introduction/installation.html) or using the [leaf cli](/docs/cli/).

- Every feature you need is available as a module, so be sure to checkout the [available modules](/modules/).

- Check out our practical videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/)

We can't wait to see what you build next!
