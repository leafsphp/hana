Hana is a simple, lightweight and easy to use React framework. It focuses on developer experience, stability and performance. Unlike the 100s of other React frameworks out there, Hana comes with a lot of features out of the box, including:

- Powerful routing
- Human state management
- Useful utilities

Hana is built on Vite and is configured to give you the best development experience. This means that you get hot module replacement, fast refresh, and more out of the box, along with everything else that Vite offers. This means you can focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration or worrying about tools.

In addition to this, Hana is built with TypeScript, which means that you get type safety out of the box. And if you are not a fan of TypeScript, you can still use Hana with plain JavaScript. Our create-hana-app CLI tool allows you to choose between TypeScript and JavaScript when creating your app.

## Our documentation

On the left side of the page, you will see a sidebar with links to all the documentation pages. The documentation is divided into sections, each covering a different topic. You can click on the links to navigate to the different sections.

The right side of the page contains the content of the documentation. You can scroll through the content to read it. You can also use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the page to navigate to the next or previous page.

We also include learning paths in the documentation. We recommend pages you might be interested in based on the page you are currently reading. You can find these at the bottom of the page labeled "Next Steps".
