# Translations <sup class="vt-badge wip" />

The Leaf documentation currently only comes in English, but we wish to support other languages for free native translations.

Translation efforts are managed in the [leafphp-translations](https://github.com/leafphp-translations/) GitHub organization. If you want to contribute, you can open an issue to express your interest.

<!-- - [Brazilian Portuguese Repo (WIP)](https://github.com/leafphp-translations/brazilian-portuguese)
- [French Repo (WIP)](https://github.com/leafphp-translations/french) -->

## Translations

There are currently the following translations underway. If you want to contribute, you can open an issue to express your interest.

- [Brazilian Portuguese (WIP)](https://pt-br.leafphp.dev)
- [French (WIP)](https://fr.leafphp.dev)

## Starting a new Translation

We are hoping to establish a standard workflow for community translations so that we can more easily coordinate community efforts. Please keep an eye on the [Translation Guidelines repo](https://github.com/leafphp-translations/guidelines/blob/main/README.md) for updates.

In the meanwhile, if you are interested in starting translation for a new language, please open a thread in the [Discussions](https://github.com/leafphp-translations/guidelines/discussions) (and check if there is already one created for your language). This can help you find fellow collaborators and avoid duplicated efforts.
